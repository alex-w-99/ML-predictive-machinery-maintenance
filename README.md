## Areas for Future Improvement

- [ ] Refine models to predict _individual_ failure codes (rather than just any failure) to enhance model robustness.
- [ ] Investigate hybrid models that combine MLPs for "static" features (e.g., machine make) and RNNs for temporal data (e.g., rotation) to improve prediction accuracy.
- [ ] Explore advanced ensemble methods to improve performance.
